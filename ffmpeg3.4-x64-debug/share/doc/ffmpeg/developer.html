<h3 class="section"><span>1.1 Notes for external developers<a class="copiable-link" href="#Notes-for-external-developers"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>This document is mostly useful for internal FFmpeg developers.
External developers who need to use the API in their application should
refer to the API doxygen documentation in the public headers, and
check the examples in <samp class="file">doc/examples</samp> and in the source code to
see how the public API is employed.
</p>
<p>You can use the FFmpeg libraries in your commercial program, but you
are encouraged to <em class="emph">publish any patch you make</em>. In this case the
best way to proceed is to send your patches to the ffmpeg-devel
mailing list following the guidelines illustrated in the remainder of
this document.
</p>
<p>For more detailed legal information about the use of FFmpeg in
external programs read the <samp class="file">LICENSE</samp> file in the source tree and
consult <a class="url" href="https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html">https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="section-level-extent" id="Contributing">
<h3 class="section"><span>1.2 Contributing<a class="copiable-link" href="#Contributing"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>There are 3 ways by which code gets into FFmpeg.
</p><ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Submitting patches to the main developer mailing list.
      See <a class="ref" href="#Submitting-patches">Submitting patches</a> for details.
</li><li>Directly committing changes to the main tree.
</li><li>Committing changes to a git clone, for example on github.com or
      gitorious.org. And asking us to merge these changes.
</li></ul>

<p>Whichever way, changes should be reviewed by the maintainer of the code
before they are committed. And they should follow the <a class="ref" href="#Coding-Rules">Coding Rules</a>.
The developer making the commit and the author are responsible for their changes
and should try to fix issues their commit causes.

<h4 class="subsection"><span>1.3.1 Code formatting conventions<a class="copiable-link" href="#Code-formatting-conventions"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>There are the following guidelines regarding the indentation in files:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Indent size is 4.

</li><li>The TAB character is forbidden outside of Makefiles as is any
form of trailing whitespace. Commits containing either will be
rejected by the git repository.

</li><li>You should try to limit your code lines to 80 characters; however, do so if
and only if this improves readability.

</li><li>K&amp;R coding style is used.
</li></ul>
<p>The presentation is one inspired by &rsquo;indent -i4 -kr -nut&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The main priority in FFmpeg is simplicity and small code size in order to
minimize the bug count.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Comments">
<h4 class="subsection"><span>1.3.2 Comments<a class="copiable-link" href="#Comments"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>Use the JavaDoc/Doxygen  format (see examples below) so that code documentation
can be generated automatically. All nontrivial functions should have a comment
above them explaining what the function does, even if it is just one sentence.
All structures and their member variables should be documented, too.
</p>
<p>Avoid Qt-style and similar Doxygen syntax with <code class="code">!</code> in it, i.e. replace
<code class="code">//!</code> with <code class="code">///</code> and similar.  Also @ syntax should be employed
for markup commands, i.e. use <code class="code">@param</code> and not <code class="code">\param</code>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">/**
 * @file
 * MPEG codec.
 * @author ...
 */

/**
 * Summary sentence.
 * more text ...
 * ...
 */
typedef struct Foobar {
    int var1; /**&lt; var1 description */
    int var2; ///&lt; var2 description
    /** var3 description */
    int var3;
} Foobar;

/**
 * Summary sentence.
 * more text ...
 * ...
 * @param my_parameter description of my_parameter
 * @return return value description
 */
int myfunc(int my_parameter)
...
</pre></div>

</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="C-language-features">
<h4 class="subsection"><span>1.3.3 C language features<a class="copiable-link" href="#C-language-features"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>FFmpeg is programmed in the ISO C90 language with a few additional
features from ISO C99, namely:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">inline</samp>&rsquo; keyword;

</li><li>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">//</samp>&rsquo; comments;

</li><li>designated struct initializers (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">struct s x = { .i = 17 };</samp>&rsquo;);

</li><li>compound literals (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">x = (struct s) { 17, 23 };</samp>&rsquo;).

</li><li>Implementation defined behavior for signed integers is assumed to match the
expected behavior for two&rsquo;s complement. Non representable values in integer
casts are binary truncated. Shift right of signed values uses sign extension.
</li></ul>

<p>These features are supported by all compilers we care about, so we will not
accept patches to remove their use unless they absolutely do not impair
clarity and performance.
</p>
<p>All code must compile with recent versions of GCC and a number of other
currently supported compilers. To ensure compatibility, please do not use
additional C99 features or GCC extensions. Especially watch out for:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>mixing statements and declarations;

</li><li>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">long long</samp>&rsquo; (use &lsquo;<samp class="samp">int64_t</samp>&rsquo; instead);

</li><li>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">__attribute__</samp>&rsquo; not protected by &lsquo;<samp class="samp">#ifdef __GNUC__</samp>&rsquo; or similar;

</li><li>GCC statement expressions (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">(x = ({ int y = 4; y; })</samp>&rsquo;).
</li></ul>

</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Naming-conventions">
<h4 class="subsection"><span>1.3.4 Naming conventions<a class="copiable-link" href="#Naming-conventions"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>All names should be composed with underscores (_), not CamelCase. For example,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">avfilter_get_video_buffer</samp>&rsquo; is an acceptable function name and
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">AVFilterGetVideo</samp>&rsquo; is not. The exception from this are type names, like
for example structs and enums; they should always be in CamelCase.
</p>
<p>There are the following conventions for naming variables and functions:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>For local variables no prefix is required.

</li><li>For file-scope variables and functions declared as <code class="code">static</code>, no prefix
is required.

</li><li>For variables and functions visible outside of file scope, but only used
internally by a library, an <code class="code">ff_</code> prefix should be used,
e.g. &lsquo;<samp class="samp">ff_w64_demuxer</samp>&rsquo;.

</li><li>For variables and functions visible outside of file scope, used internally
across multiple libraries, use <code class="code">avpriv_</code> as prefix, for example,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">avpriv_aac_parse_header</samp>&rsquo;.

</li><li>Each library has its own prefix for public symbols, in addition to the
commonly used <code class="code">av_</code> (<code class="code">avformat_</code> for libavformat,
<code class="code">avcodec_</code> for libavcodec, <code class="code">swr_</code> for libswresample, etc).
Check the existing code and choose names accordingly.
Note that some symbols without these prefixes are also exported for
retro-compatibility reasons. These exceptions are declared in the
<code class="code">lib&lt;name&gt;/lib&lt;name&gt;.v</code> files.
</li></ul>

<p>Furthermore, name space reserved for the system should not be invaded.
Identifiers ending in <code class="code">_t</code> are reserved by
<a class="url" href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/functions/xsh_chap02_02.html#tag_02_02_02">POSIX</a>.
Also avoid names starting with <code class="code">__</code> or <code class="code">_</code> followed by an uppercase
letter as they are reserved by the C standard. Names starting with <code class="code">_</code>
are reserved at the file level and may not be used for externally visible
symbols. If in doubt, just avoid names starting with <code class="code">_</code> altogether.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Miscellaneous-conventions">
<h4 class="subsection"><span>1.3.5 Miscellaneous conventions<a class="copiable-link" href="#Miscellaneous-conventions"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>fprintf and printf are forbidden in libavformat and libavcodec,
please use av_log() instead.

</li><li>Casts should be used only when necessary. Unneeded parentheses
should also be avoided if they don&rsquo;t make the code easier to understand.
</li></ul>

</div>
<div class="subsection-level-extent" id="Editor-configuration">
<h4 class="subsection"><span>1.3.6 Editor configuration<a class="copiable-link" href="#Editor-configuration"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>In order to configure Vim to follow FFmpeg formatting conventions, paste
the following snippet into your <samp class="file">.vimrc</samp>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&quot; indentation rules for FFmpeg: 4 spaces, no tabs
set expandtab
set shiftwidth=4
set softtabstop=4
set cindent
set cinoptions=(0
&quot; Allow tabs in Makefiles.
autocmd FileType make,automake set noexpandtab shiftwidth=8 softtabstop=8
&quot; Trailing whitespace and tabs are forbidden, so highlight them.
highlight ForbiddenWhitespace ctermbg=red guibg=red
match ForbiddenWhitespace /\s\+$\|\t/
&quot; Do not highlight spaces at the end of line while typing on that line.
autocmd InsertEnter * match ForbiddenWhitespace /\t\|\s\+\%#\@&lt;!$/
</pre></div>

<p>For Emacs, add these roughly equivalent lines to your <samp class="file">.emacs.d/init.el</samp>:
</p><div class="example lisp">

<p>This means unfinished code which is enabled and breaks compilation,
or compiles but does not work/breaks the regression tests. Code which
is unfinished but disabled may be permitted under-circumstances, like
missing samples or an implementation with a small subset of features.
Always check the mailing list for any reviewers with issues and test
FATE before you push.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="Keep-the-main-commit-message-short-with-an-extended-description-below_002e"><span>Keep the main commit message short with an extended description below.<a class="copiable-link" href="#Keep-the-main-commit-message-short-with-an-extended-description-below_002e"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>The commit message should have a short first line in the form of
a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">topic: short description</samp>&rsquo; as a header, separated by a newline
from the body consisting of an explanation of why the change is necessary.
If the commit fixes a known bug on the bug tracker, the commit message
should include its bug ID. Referring to the issue on the bug tracker does
not exempt you from writing an excerpt of the bug in the commit message.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="Testing-must-be-adequate-but-not-excessive_002e"><span>Testing must be adequate but not excessive.<a class="copiable-link" href="#Testing-must-be-adequate-but-not-excessive_002e"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>If it works for you, others, and passes FATE then it should be OK to commit
it, provided it fits the other committing criteria. You should not worry about
over-testing things. If your code has problems (portability, triggers
compiler bugs, unusual environment etc) they will be reported and eventually
fixed.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="Do-not-commit-unrelated-changes-together_002e"><span>Do not commit unrelated changes together.<a class="copiable-link" href="#Do-not-commit-unrelated-changes-together_002e"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>They should be split them into self-contained pieces. Also do not forget
that if part B depends on part A, but A does not depend on B, then A can
and should be committed first and separate from B. Keeping changes well
split into self-contained parts makes reviewing and understanding them on
the commit log mailing list easier. This also helps in case of debugging
later on.
Also if you have doubts about splitting or not splitting, do not hesitate to
ask/discuss it on the developer mailing list.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="Ask-before-you-change-the-build-system-_0028configure_002c-etc_0029_002e"><span>Ask before you change the build system (configure, etc).<a class="copiable-link" href="#Ask-before-you-change-the-build-system-_0028configure_002c-etc_0029_002e"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>Do not commit changes to the build system (Makefiles, configure script)
which change behavior, defaults etc, without asking first. The same
applies to compiler warning fixes, trivial looking fixes and to code
maintained by other developers. We usually have a reason for doing things
the way we do. Send your changes as patches to the ffmpeg-devel mailing
list, and if the code maintainers say OK, you may commit. This does not
apply to files you wrote and/or maintain.
</p>
<h4 class="subheading" id="Cosmetic-changes-should-be-kept-in-separate-patches_002e"><span>Cosmetic changes should be kept in separate patches.<a class="copiable-link" href="#Cosmetic-changes-should-be-kept-in-separate-patches_002e"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<p>We refuse source indentation and other cosmetic changes if they are mixed
with functional changes, such commits will be rejected and removed. Every
developer has his own indentation style, you should not change it. Of course
if you (re)write something, you can use your own style, even though we would
prefer if the indentation throughout FFmpeg was consistent (Many projects
force a given indentation style - we do not.). If you really need to make
indentation changes (try to avoid this), separate them strictly from real
changes.
</p>
<p>NOTE: If you had to put if(){ .. } over a large (&gt; 5 lines) chunk of code,
then either do NOT change the indentation of the inner part within (do not
move it to the right)! or do so in a separate commit

<p>Always fill out the commit log message. Describe in a few lines what you
changed and why. You can refer to mailing list postings if you fix a
particular bug. Comments such as &quot;fixed!&quot; or &quot;Changed it.&quot; are unacceptable.

answer to ffmpeg-devel (or wherever you got the patch from) saying that
you applied the patch.

<p>Do NOT commit to code actively maintained by others without permission.
Send a patch to ffmpeg-devel. If no one answers within a reasonable
time-frame (12h for build failures and security fixes, 3 days small changes,
1 week for big patches) then commit your patch if you think it is OK.

<p>Depending on the change, you may need to change the version integer.
Incrementing the first component means no backward compatibility to
previous versions (e.g. removal of a function from the public API).
Incrementing the second component means backward compatible change
(e.g. addition of a function to the public API or extension of an
existing data structure).
Incrementing the third component means a noteworthy binary compatible
change (e.g. encoder bug fix that matters for the decoder). The third
component always starts at 100 to distinguish FFmpeg from Libav.

<p>Compiler warnings indicate potential bugs or code with bad style. If a type of
warning always points to correct and clean code, that warning should
be disabled, not the code changed.
Thus the remaining warnings can either be bugs or correct code.
If it is a bug, the bug has to be fixed. If it is not, the code should
be changed to not generate a warning unless that causes a slowdown
or obfuscates the code.

<h3 class="section"><span>1.5 Code of conduct<a class="copiable-link" href="#Code-of-conduct"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Be friendly and respectful towards others and third parties.
Treat others the way you yourself want to be treated.
</p>
<p>Be considerate. Not everyone shares the same viewpoint and priorities as you do.
Different opinions and interpretations help the project.
Looking at issues from a different perspective assists development.
</p>
<p>Do not assume malice for things that can be attributed to incompetence. Even if
it is malice, it&rsquo;s rarely good to start with that as initial assumption.
</p>
<p>Stay friendly even if someone acts contrarily. Everyone has a bad day
once in a while.
If you yourself have a bad day or are angry then try to take a break and reply
once you are calm and without anger if you have to.
</p>
<p>Try to help other team members and cooperate if you can.
</p>
<p>The goal of software development is to create technical excellence, not for any
individual to be better and &quot;win&quot; against the others. Large software projects
are only possible and successful through teamwork.
</p>
<p>If someone struggles do not put them down. Give them a helping hand
instead and point them in the right direction.
</p>
<p>Finally, keep in mind the immortal words of Bill and Ted,
&quot;Be excellent to each other.&quot;

<div class="section-level-extent" id="Submitting-patches-1">
<h3 class="section"><span>1.6 Submitting patches<a class="copiable-link" href="#Submitting-patches-1"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>First, read the <a class="ref" href="#Coding-Rules">Coding Rules</a> above if you did not yet, in particular
the rules regarding patch submission.
</p>
<p>When you submit your patch, please use <code class="code">git format-patch</code> or
<code class="code">git send-email</code>. We cannot read other diffs :-).
</p>
<p>Also please do not submit a patch which contains several unrelated changes.
Split it into separate, self-contained pieces. This does not mean splitting
file by file. Instead, make the patch as small as possible while still
keeping it as a logical unit that contains an individual change, even
if it spans multiple files. This makes reviewing your patches much easier
for us and greatly increases your chances of getting your patch applied.
</p>
<p>Use the patcheck tool of FFmpeg to check your patch.
The tool is located in the tools directory.
</p>
<p>Run the <a class="ref" href="#Regression-tests">Regression tests</a> before submitting a patch in order to verify
it does not cause unexpected problems.
</p>
<p>It also helps quite a bit if you tell us what the patch does (for example
&rsquo;replaces lrint by lrintf&rsquo;), and why (for example &rsquo;*BSD isn&rsquo;t C99 compliant
and has no lrint()&rsquo;)
</p>
<p>Also please if you send several patches, send each patch as a separate mail,
do not attach several unrelated patches to the same mail.
</p>
<p>Patches should be posted to the
<a class="uref" href="https://lists.ffmpeg.org/mailman/listinfo/ffmpeg-devel">ffmpeg-devel</a>
mailing list. Use <code class="code">git send-email</code> when possible since it will properly
send patches without requiring extra care. If you cannot, then send patches
as base64-encoded attachments, so your patch is not trashed during
transmission. Also ensure the correct mime type is used
(text/x-diff or text/x-patch or at least text/plain) and that only one
patch is inline or attached per mail.
You can check <a class="url" href="https://patchwork.ffmpeg.org">https://patchwork.ffmpeg.org</a>, if your patch does not show up, its mime type
likely was wrong.
</p>
<p>Your patch will be reviewed on the mailing list. You will likely be asked
to make some changes and are expected to send in an improved version that
incorporates the requests from the review. This process may go through
several iterations. Once your patch is deemed good enough, some developer
will pick it up and commit it to the official FFmpeg tree.
</p>
<p>Give us a few days to react. But if some time passes without reaction,
send a reminder by email. Your patch should eventually be dealt with.

<ol class="enumerate">
<li> Did you use av_cold for codec initialization and close functions?

</li><li> Did you add a long_name under NULL_IF_CONFIG_SMALL to the AVCodec or
AVInputFormat/AVOutputFormat struct?

</li><li> Did you bump the minor version number (and reset the micro version
number) in <samp class="file">libavcodec/version.h</samp> or <samp class="file">libavformat/version.h</samp>?

</li><li> Did you register it in <samp class="file">allcodecs.c</samp> or <samp class="file">allformats.c</samp>?

</li><li> Did you add the AVCodecID to <samp class="file">avcodec.h</samp>?
When adding new codec IDs, also add an entry to the codec descriptor
list in <samp class="file">libavcodec/codec_desc.c</samp>.

</li><li> If it has a FourCC, did you add it to <samp class="file">libavformat/riff.c</samp>,
even if it is only a decoder?

</li><li> Did you add a rule to compile the appropriate files in the Makefile?
Remember to do this even if you&rsquo;re just adding a format to a file that is
already being compiled by some other rule, like a raw demuxer.

</li><li> Did you add an entry to the table of supported formats or codecs in
<samp class="file">doc/general.texi</samp>?

</li><li> Did you add an entry in the Changelog?

</li><li> If it depends on a parser or a library, did you add that dependency in
configure?

</li><li> Did you <code class="code">git add</code> the appropriate files before committing?

</li><li> Did you make sure it compiles standalone, i.e. with
<code class="code">configure --disable-everything --enable-decoder=foo</code>
(or <code class="code">--enable-demuxer</code> or whatever your component is)?

</li><li> Did you provide a clear git commit log message?

</li><li> Is the patch against latest FFmpeg git master branch?

</li><li> Are you subscribed to ffmpeg-devel?
(the list is subscribers only due to spam)

</li><li> Have you checked that the changes are minimal, so that the same cannot be
achieved with a smaller patch and/or simpler final code?

</li><li> If the change is to speed critical code, did you benchmark it?

</li><li> If you did any benchmarks, did you provide them in the mail?

</li><li> Have you checked that the patch does not introduce buffer overflows or
other security issues?

</li><li> Did you test your decoder or demuxer against damaged data? If no, see
tools/trasher, the noise bitstream filter, and
<a class="uref" href="http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/zzuf">zzuf</a>. Your decoder or demuxer
should not crash, end in a (near) infinite loop, or allocate ridiculous
amounts of memory when fed damaged data.

</li><li> Did you test your decoder or demuxer against sample files?
Samples may be obtained at <a class="url" href="https://samples.ffmpeg.org">https://samples.ffmpeg.org</a>.

</li><li> Does the patch not mix functional and cosmetic changes?

</li><li> Did you add tabs or trailing whitespace to the code? Both are forbidden.

</li><li> Is the patch attached to the email you send?

</li><li> Is the mime type of the patch correct? It should be text/x-diff or
text/x-patch or at least text/plain and not application/octet-stream.

</li><li> If the patch fixes a bug, did you provide a verbose analysis of the bug?

</li><li> If the patch fixes a bug, did you provide enough information, including
a sample, so the bug can be reproduced and the fix can be verified?
Note please do not attach samples &gt;100k to mails but rather provide a
URL, you can upload to ftp://upload.ffmpeg.org.

</li><li> Did you provide a verbose summary about what the patch does change?

</li><li> Did you provide a verbose explanation why it changes things like it does?

</li><li> Did you provide a verbose summary of the user visible advantages and
disadvantages if the patch is applied?

</li><li> Did you provide an example so we can verify the new feature added by the
patch easily?

</li><li> If you added a new file, did you insert a license header? It should be
taken from FFmpeg, not randomly copied and pasted from somewhere else.

</li><li> You should maintain alphabetical order in alphabetically ordered lists as
long as doing so does not break API/ABI compatibility.

</li><li> Lines with similar content should be aligned vertically when doing so
improves readability.

</li><li> Consider adding a regression test for your code.

</li><li> If you added YASM code please check that things still work with &ndash;disable-yasm.

</li><li> Make sure you check the return values of function and return appropriate
error codes. Especially memory allocation functions like <code class="code">av_malloc()</code>
are notoriously left unchecked, which is a serious problem.

</li><li> Test your code with valgrind and or Address Sanitizer to ensure it&rsquo;s free
of leaks, out of array accesses, etc.

<div class="section-level-extent" id="Patch-review-process">
<h3 class="section"><span>1.9 Patch review process<a class="copiable-link" href="#Patch-review-process"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>All patches posted to ffmpeg-devel will be reviewed, unless they contain a
clear note that the patch is not for the git master branch.
Reviews and comments will be posted as replies to the patch on the
mailing list. The patch submitter then has to take care of every comment,
that can be by resubmitting a changed patch or by discussion. Resubmitted
patches will themselves be reviewed like any other patch. If at some point
a patch passes review with no comments then it is approved, that can for
simple and small patches happen immediately while large patches will generally
have to be changed and reviewed many times before they are approved.
After a patch is approved it will be committed to the repository.
</p>
<p>We will review all submitted patches, but sometimes we are quite busy so
especially for large patches this can take several weeks.
</p>
<p>If you feel that the review process is too slow and you are willing to try to
take over maintainership of the area of code you change then just clone
git master and maintain the area of code there. We will merge each area from
where its best maintained.
</p>
<p>When resubmitting patches, please do not make any significant changes
not related to the comments received during review. Such patches will
be rejected. Instead, submit significant changes or new features as
separate patches.
</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to review patches. Also if you are waiting for your patch
to be reviewed, please consider helping to review other patches, that is a great
way to get everyone&rsquo;s patches reviewed sooner.

<p>When there is no muxer or encoder available to generate test media for a
specific test then the media has to be included in the fate-suite.
First please make sure that the sample file is as small as possible to test the
respective decoder or demuxer sufficiently. Large files increase network
bandwidth and disk space requirements.
Once you have a working fate test and fate sample, provide in the commit
message or introductory message for the patch series that you post to
the ffmpeg-devel mailing list, a direct link to download the sample media.

<p>The FFmpeg build system allows visualizing the test coverage in an easy
manner with the coverage tools <code class="code">gcov</code>/<code class="code">lcov</code>.  This involves
the following steps:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> Configure to compile with instrumentation enabled:
    <code class="code">configure --toolchain=gcov</code>.

</li><li> Run your test case, either manually or via FATE. This can be either
    the full FATE regression suite, or any arbitrary invocation of any
    front-end tool provided by FFmpeg, in any combination.

</li><li> Run <code class="code">make lcov</code> to generate coverage data in HTML format.

</li><li> View <code class="code">lcov/index.html</code> in your preferred HTML viewer.
</li></ol>

<p>You can use the command <code class="code">make lcov-reset</code> to reset the coverage

<code class="code">--toolchain=valgrind-memcheck</code> or <code class="code">--toolchain=valgrind-massif</code>
to your configure line, and reasonable defaults will be set for running
FATE under the supervision of either the <strong class="strong">memcheck</strong> or the
<strong class="strong">massif</strong> tool of the valgrind suite.
</p>
<p>In case you need finer control over how valgrind is invoked, use the

<a class="url" href="https://ffmpeg.org">https://ffmpeg.org</a> website.
</p>
<p>There are two kinds of releases:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> <strong class="strong">Major releases</strong> always include the latest and greatest

<p>Note that we promise to our users that shared libraries from any FFmpeg
release never break programs that have been <strong class="strong">compiled</strong> against
previous versions of <strong class="strong">the same release series</strong> in any case!
</p>
<p>However, from time to time, we do make API changes that require adaptations
in applications. Such changes are only allowed in (new) major releases and
